This bug occurs when using Expo's `Linking` API to handle deep links.  The `Linking.addEventListener` method might not consistently trigger the callback function when an app is opened from a deep link, particularly when the app is already running in the background. This results in the app failing to handle the deep link properly, even though the link is correctly formatted and the event listener seems to be correctly set up. The problem seems to be intermittent; sometimes it works, other times it does not, making debugging difficult.
